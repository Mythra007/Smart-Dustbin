# Smart-Dustbin
Simulated a multi-sensor-based smart dustbin using Arduino to detect motion, orientation, light, and temperature with interactive feedback.
# Smart Dustbin Simulation (Embedded IoT Project)

An Arduino-based simulation of a **smart waste bin** that uses multiple sensors and actuators to detect object presence, monitor environment conditions, and provide feedback.

## Features
- Ultrasonic sensor for distance-based lid operation
- PIR motion sensor for presence detection
- LDR for ambient light sensing
- Tilt sensor to check bin orientation
- Temperature sensor (TMP36) for environment monitoring
- Servo motor for lid actuation
- Buzzer and LEDs for alert system
- I2C LCD display for status updates

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04, PIR, LDR, Tilt, TMP36
- Servo motor, Buzzer, LED
- I2C LCD 16x2 Display

## Code Highlights
- Sensor fusion for intelligent responses
- Servo control based on distance
- Alert logic with LEDs and buzzer
- Real-time display via I2C LCD

## Simulation
Simulated in Proteus / Tinkercad
